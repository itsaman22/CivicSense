# 🚨 DEPLOYMENT ISSUE FIXED!

## Problem Identified:
Your frontend was making API calls to relative URLs (`/api/auth/login`) instead of the full backend URL, causing 404 errors.

## Root Cause:
- **Auth.jsx** was using relative paths: `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/register`
- When frontend and backend are on different domains, relative paths don't work
- The proxy in vite.config.js only works in development, not in production

## ✅ Fixes Applied:

### 1. Updated Auth.jsx:
```javascript
// BEFORE (causing 404):
const endpoint = isLogin ? '/api/auth/login' : '/api/auth/register';

// AFTER (working):
const baseUrl = 'https://civicsense-backend-9oc8.onrender.com';
const endpoint = isLogin ? `${baseUrl}/api/auth/login` : `${baseUrl}/api/auth/register`;
```

### 2. Updated vite.config.js:
- Reset proxy to localhost for local development only
- Production deployments use full URLs, not proxy

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Redeploy your frontend** on Render (it should automatically deploy from GitHub)
2. **Test login functionality** - it should work now!
3. **Check all features**:
   - ✅ User registration/login
   - ✅ Browse issues
   - ✅ Post new issues with location features
   - ✅ Voting and commenting

## 📝 CSS MIME Type Warning:
The CSS warning is likely a caching issue that should resolve after redeployment.

## 🔧 For Better Production Setup (Optional):
Consider updating your backend CORS to be more specific:

```javascript
// In Backend/server.js
app.use(cors({
  origin: [
    'http://localhost:3000',  // Local development
    'https://civicsense-frontend.onrender.com',  // Your actual frontend URL
  ],
  credentials: true
}));
```

The login issue should now be resolved! 🎉
